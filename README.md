# Todo-list
creating todo list by React

Demo is https://julia-dizhak.github.io/react-todo-list/todo-list/demo/

## Todo list desc
* initial state
* handle the submit
* populate state
* display tasks
* add finish touches

## Redux
* difference between actions and dispatches

## Working with external data
* app makes a request for some data to a remote service;
* the remote service recieves the request and sends some data back;
* app receives the data;
* app formats and displays data to the user;

## Menu by react-motion
* animating property value changes;
* synchronizing animations on a timeline;
* staggering animations across a range of elements;
* animate an element before it appears, or animate it before it gets removed;
* animate an element across views/routes;
* The spring function takes care of interpolating values from a starting point to an ending point;

## Tests with Jest
* yarn test
* should write tests first

### Todo:
* don't push empty task in todo
* migrate to state and show how many tasks now in DisplayCounter

* new challenge: operation +, -, ... (add multiple, division)
* move file to utils
* action.type
